To start this application, create an instance of class "Game" and call its
"play" method.

The player begins in a hospital and quickly realizes that something is wrong.
They are not safe. They don't remember how they arrived. They must escape.

**SPOILER**
Two gameplay examples are included as Tutorial1 and Tutorial2, as well as a WinningSequence.txt
featureList.txt lists out the main features of the game per grade level
Map.txt contains the output of the Game.displayMapFull() method and shows the layout in an orderly manner
The worldInit file lacks formatting and must be interpreted that way (was written in vim)
BlueJ was used to create this game, and is necessary to run the game as-is.
Feel free to add your own contributions, plot updates, or ideas to this repo. We'd love to see them!
