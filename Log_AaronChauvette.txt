3/16/17
4:30 PM Completed the "Killer mingame" idea.
	Rock/paper/scissors style combat system with health and 4 options (Strike/Block/Feint/Parry)
	Loser of each round takes damage based on what item the winner is using. Parry only wins against Strike, but does additional damage

9:20 PM Met with Gavin
Discussed game.Java
Created an item class
mapped out rooms
10:15 PM Ran into an issue: We didn't know what we wanted to start with (Priorities - Rooms/classes/items)
10:23 PM Talked about the "Killer" NPC and how the AI will move/how the location is determined. Had an idea to make it a boolean switch
My design would have the NPC choose a random valid door each turn excluding the direction it just entered from unless it is the only valid move.
Thought about changing the boolean idea because there could be an easier way to check
10:33 PM Talked about using switch/case and multi-word-phrases in parser
Moved focus back to game class and layout
10:41 PM Worked on description of the game/how to win
10:50 PM talked about ideas for character builds
11:00 PM Agreed to meet Gavin tomorrow to work more.
