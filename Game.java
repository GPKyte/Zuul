/**
 *  This is the main class of Zuul, a test-based adventure game.
 *  It is adapted from a basic version out of this book:
 *  
 *     Objects First with Java - A Practical Introduction using BlueJ
 *     Sixth edition
 *     David J. Barnes and Michael KÃ¶lling
 *     Pearson Education, 2016
 *  
 *  To play this game, create an instance of this class and call the "play"
 *  method.
 * 
 *  This main class creates and initialises all the others: it creates all
 *  rooms, creates the parser and starts the game.  It also evaluates and
 *  executes the commands that the parser returns.
